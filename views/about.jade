		h3 About the project
		p
			| MercadoLibre's a big and complex web site with a lot of needs.
		p
			| Every development and design team needed to be able to build quality and consistent web apps using an agile development process.
		p
			| So we had to find a way to unify the process and guarantee design pattern and user experience quality for every team. And Chico was born.
