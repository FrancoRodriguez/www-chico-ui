h3#create-modal Create a new Modal
p
	| First, we'll have to create our Modal to work on it. You have to store Chico UI's components in a JavaScript variable in order to access the public 
	a(href="/api/#{latest.version}/symbols/ch.Modal.html#!methods") methods
	|  and 
	a(href="/api/#{latest.version}/symbols/ch.Modal.html#!properties") properties
	| . In this case, we are storing our Modal in the
	code myModal
	|  variable.
p
	| The Modal will have this configuration:
pre
	| var myModal = $("#modal").modal("<p>This is a modal window with static content.</p>");

h3#change-content Is the content boring? Change it!
p
	| We'll change the content using, as setter, the
	code content
	|  method:
pre
	| myModal.content("New content for myModal, using the content() method.");	
p
	|Â See more on 
	a(href="/api/#{latest.version}/symbols/ch.Modal.html#.content") Modal documentation
	| .

h3#new-content New content!
p
	| Now, if we use the 
	code content
	|  method as getter:
pre
	| myModal.content();
p
	| It returns:
pre
	| "New content for myModal, using the content() method."
p
	| This is simple, therefore you can try and change the Modal's content on your projects.
