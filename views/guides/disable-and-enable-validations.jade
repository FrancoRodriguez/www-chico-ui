h3#create-your-validations Create your validations
p
	| First, you'll initilize the 
	a(href="/widgets/watcher") Watchers
	|  that you will use in your project.
p
	| In this case, we'll create a
	code required
	|  validation.
pre
	| var requiredVal = $(".field-req").required("This field is required.");
p
	| You should store Chico UI's components in a JavaScript variable in order to access the methods and properties.

h3#disable-a-watcher Disable a Watcher
p
	| To disable this Watcher, you only must use the 
	code disable
	|  method. Therefore, the next time that you run validation, this Watcher will not execute.
pre
	| requiredVal.disable();

h3#enable-a-watcher Enable a Watcher
p
	| Now, if you want to enable it again, you must use the 
	code enable
	|  method.
pre
	| requiredVal.enable();
