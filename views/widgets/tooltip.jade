p
	| As you can see, we pass a configuration object to the 
	code position
	|  method with some properties. The 
	code offset
	|  property let you define a specific pixel values for 
	code X
	|  and 
	code Y
	|  axis indentation.
p
	| The 
	code points
	|Â  property defines the position relation between the element and its context. In this case, the value 
	code "lt lb"
	|  literally says: 
	cite 
		| The element will be positioned by joining its left-bottom point with its context by its left-top point.
